=Introduction=
jQuery extensions is a set of methods added to the jQuery object for common Javascript tasks. While these functions could easily be global ones, adding them as a plugin

These functions are in the style of similar Mochikit/Prototype functions.

=Download=
The downloads comes as either the minified script, or a full zip with the tests (and example usage) and un-minified source. The un-minified source contains Javascript documentation and Visual Studio friendly documentation too.

=Example=


	$.isNumber(42);

	var x;
	$.isUndefined(x);
	$.isNullOrUndefined(x);
	$.isString(false);

	$.emptyString("the quick brown fox");
	$.startsWith("the quick brown fox","the");
	$.formatString("Here is the {0} and {2}","first","second");


=Documentation=
Full documentation will arrive shortly.

The plugin obviously has room to grow. Recommendations for improvements to the source or new functions are welcome, or contributing as a member.
